# revm - Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine

Fork of [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) that uses 176 bit 22 byte ICAN addresses.

To run tests:
```bash
cargo test --all --all-features
```

### Disclaimer
Precompile part of the REVM isn't yet working with H176

Tests are passing but will need more testing
